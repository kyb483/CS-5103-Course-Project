# CS-5103-Course-Project

Strings and Words: In this project you are writing a program to perform various word statistics of a given document (as a string). The initial requirement is to count the frequency of each unique word. The code should support combinations of space, tab, and newline characters as separators.


To run:
1. Download both the Project_Code.py and the test1.txt file and place it in the same directory.
2. Open terminal on your device and navigate to the directory that you saved both files to.
3. Type the command 'python3 Project_Code.py'

Modifications:
This program can take text  files and give the frequency of each uniqe word. You have to change the name of the text file and make sure that file and this program are in the same directory. In addition, you must also change the name in line 28 to do the  testing on that file. 


Test Case
1. Checking to see if the particular word is present in the string.
   Test 1 - word we check is "the" (True)
   Test 2 - word we check is "look" (False)
2. Checking to see if a particular words occurrence  is accurate. 
   Test 1 - word we check is "the" for occurrence  of 3 (True)
   Test 2 - word we check is "way" for occurrence  of 3 (False)
